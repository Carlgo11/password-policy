# Password policy file

Password policies vary a lot between websites. Therefore I wanted to explore different ways of telling users and programs the exact password policies for sites.  
One way of doing that is by creating a dedicated file on the webserver that describes the password policy or policies on that specific website.

__In this repository you'll find some of my ideas for how such a file would look like.__

If you have any ideas on improvement or questions then please make an [issue](https://github.com/Carlgo11/password-policy/issues) or a [pull request](https://github.com/Carlgo11/password-policy/pulls).
